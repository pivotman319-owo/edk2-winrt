This repo exists solely to support legacy NT6.2/NT6.3 emulation efforts on QEMU. It is derieved from driver1998's efforts to make ARMv7 NT workable on the QEMU emulator, and further integrates fixes from gailium119's version of their EDK2 tree, in addition to restoring GitHub Actions support for building edk2 against Python 2.7 (legacy).
